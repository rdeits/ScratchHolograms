=============
About:
=============
This is a program designed to make it easier to create scratch holograms (see
http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/amateur/holo1.html). It allows the user to create a
3D model in Google SketchUp, and then convert that model into a pattern to
generate a hologram of the model. 

=============
Requirements:
=============
python 2.6 or 2.7 with Matplotlib and Numpy
Google SketchUp

=============
Installation:
=============
Currently, this is only tested on OS X 10.6 and 10.7. It can probably be made to
work on other systems relatively easily, but I haven't done so yet. 

Install SDXF from http://www.kellbot.com/sdxf-python-library-for-dxf/

Open up solid_pattern.rb: change the value of SCRIPTS_DIR to point to the
location of this Readme file, and change PYTHON_PATH to point to your python
executable. Next, copy (or symlink) solid_pattern.rb to your Google Sketchup Plugins
folder (/Library/Application\ Support/Google\ SketchUp\ 8/SketchUp/plugins/ on
OS X). 

=============
Usage:
=============
Create a new model in SketchUp (or open up one of the samples provided with
this distribution), and save it somewhere convenient. Then click Plugins ->
Make Solid Scratch Pattern... and save the *.pattern file in whatever folder
you want the pattern files to appear in. Shortly thereafter, the printable
pattern file (.pdf), the drawing file for CNC milling (.dxf), and simulated
views at two viewing angles (_view_+5.pdf, etc.) will appear in the same
folder. 

A few notes on usage:
The X and Y coordinates of the generated hologram correspond entirely to the
camera's X and Y axes, and the Z coordinate is the depth relative to the
projection of the origin onto the line of view.  This means that an object
centered on the origin will have a hologram of points elements with positive
and negative z values, while an object on the opposite side of the origin from
the camera will have entirely negative z values (and thus be entirely below the
page when the hologram is viewed)
